# Blogging Application

## This blogging App enables USERS to post POSTS and view/read posts of other users they follow. 

- It enables users to follow each other. 
- It allows logged in users to chat
- It allows logged in users to search posts in real time. 
- ONLY the post owner can perform CRUD operations to his/her posts. 
- The registration process utilizes both front-end validation (enhances user experience) and back-end validation to ensure malicious users don't succeed in their endevours once they compromise the front-end. 

## I built the App adhering to Cross Site Forgery (CFS) security and using the modern technologies.
